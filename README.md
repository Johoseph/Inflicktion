Inflicktion is a 2024 Advent Calendar made for my partner Flick. This project was built using Vite's Vue template, and has taken inspiration from the [Inscryption](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1092790/Inscryption/) video/card game.

Each day of advent, a new card featuring art of our dog Charlie can be revealed. I used [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer) to create the cards. This was super fun to make and I think it turned out well!
